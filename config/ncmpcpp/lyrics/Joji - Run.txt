I fell for your magic
I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic
At least I found the end
I witness your madness
You shed light on my sins
And if we share in this sadness
Then where have you been?

I know you're not in love
Like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one
Like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck
In this misery
Guess I'm not enough
Like you used to think
So I'll just run

You bathe in your victory
You blew out on my fuse
And if I took on the planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love was a mystery
Yeah my love is a fool
And I travel the country
Just to get to you

I know you're not in love
Like you used to be
I guess I'm not the one
Like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck
In this misery
Guess I'm not enough
Like you used to think
So I'll just run

And I travel the country
And I travel the country
Just to get to you
I know you're not in love
I know you're not in love
I know you're not in love
